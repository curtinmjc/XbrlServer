                        h4 Concepts Over Time
                        p As any US filer is aware, the SEC continually releases new taxonomies for filing XBRL data.  This being the case elements have different namespaces over time.  For example, a filer reporting their assets in 2009 would have used us-gaap:Assets where us-gaap equals "http://xbrl.us/us-gaap/2009-01-31" but a filer filing assets in 2013 would have used us-gaap:Assets where us-gaap equals "http://fasb.org/us-gaap-std/2013-01-31".  How can we then graph Assets over time if the XML elements are not strictly equal?  Simple, we match on name. "Assets" is considered "Assets" no matter its target namespace (this applies to all elements).
                        p This approach could produce some inconsistencies, but I feel that the likelihood of this is low enough that its simplicity is warranted.  It may be possible to maintain a mapping of deprecated elements and their replacements, but this would make queries much more complex and time consuming.
                        p Also, this may encourage the adoption of things like the XBRL versioning spec, which would make maintaining such mappings much, much easier.
                    .col-md-4
                        h4 Duration Concepts
                        p Itâ€™s a trivial matter to create a line graph of a number of facts that occur at a number of particular instants in time.  Just arrange them in order of time on the X axis, by value on the Y axis, and connect the dots from left to right.  Indeed this is exactly how a concept like Assets is graphed.  Facts that represent a duration in time are a little trickier.  Cash flow for example, is generally recorded as how much flow occurred over a period (e.g. a quarter or YTD).
                        p To make things even more difficult most US filers report information for multiple durations for the same concept!  For example, in Q1 over the quarter, in Q2 and Q3 over the quarter and YTD, and finally over the entire year.  This can result in many overlapping periods (six, in this example) that cannot all be graphed at the same time.
                        p With this in mind, only duration concepts that represent an entire year (annual) or those that represent a quarter (quarterly) are displayed.  For quarterly facts, sometimes one quarter can be "missing" (e.g. Q1, Q2, Q3, Q1).  This is due to the way that 10Q/10K filings happen, Q4 is generally not reported separately in the annual filing.  The data point could be inferred, but here only what data is reported is displayed.
